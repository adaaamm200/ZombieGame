### 2026-07-08 — Fix rendered icon clipping and back button sizing
- Goal: Make icons fully visible in the ACTUAL rendered UI (not just the source PNG),
  and fix the oversized Armory/Lab/Settings back button.
- Files changed: css/style.css, tools/crop.js, assets/ui/m-*.png + s-*.png (regenerated),
  sw.js (cache zk-v23), docs/qa/VISUAL_QA_CHECKLIST.md, docs/STATUS.md, CHANGELOG_AI.md.
- What changed:
  - Back button: added `.btn .aic-btn, .backbtn .aic-btn { width:26px; height:26px }` and
    `.aic { max-width:100%; max-height:100% }` — no more 256px natural-size blowup
    (button was 294×278, now 64×48 with a 26px icon).
  - Icon inner scale: crop.js TARGET 238→200 so each padded icon fills ~70% of the 256
    canvas → clear margin, never touches the badge/hexagon/octagon edge in the rendered UI.
    Menu octagons + board state hexagons regenerated.
  - QA checklist: added the rule that icon PASS requires full visibility in the rendered
    UI container, and to prefer a smaller inner scale over edge-touching icons.
- Tests run: node --check all JS (OK); screenshots of main menu, board, armory, settings,
  in-game HUD, mobile board; DOM metrics for back-button and viewport; 0 console errors.
- Visual QA: PASS — icons fully visible with clear margin; back button fixed; no regression.
- What was not changed: gameplay, weapon/enemy stats, economy, save, campaign progress,
  board background, sprites, in-game control icons (ic-*).
- Open questions: minor green remnants (weapon stat bars, "STAGE 1" banner, lang toggle)
  left for an optional polish round.
- Next recommended step: optional green-remnant polish, or proceed to M2 (day board system).

### 2026-07-08 — Project memory and agent system setup
- Goal: Create persistent project memory, agent definitions, asset pipeline documentation and visual QA rules.
- Files changed: CLAUDE.md (extended), AGENTS.md, TASKS.md, CHANGELOG_AI.md,
  docs/vision/* (8 files), docs/asset_pipeline/* (2), docs/prompts/* (1),
  docs/qa/* (1), docs/references/README.md, .claude/agents/* (5).
- What changed: Documentation, agent role cards and workflow only.
- Tests run: none needed (no JS changed).
- Visual QA: n/a (no visual change).
- Gameplay changes: none.
- Asset implementation changes: none.
- What was not changed: game logic, UI/CSS, sprites, assets, save system, sw.js.
- Open questions: none.
- Next recommended step: Day 1 campaign board and icon crop visual audit.
